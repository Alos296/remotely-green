# remotely-green

To run the server, make sure you have `flask` installed (for example via `pip`) and then run `app.py`. The server will run on localhost (usually port 5000) as printed in the debugger.

Everytime we push on `master`, a deployment is triggered on Heroku. The server is available [here](https://remotely-green.herokuapp.com/).
